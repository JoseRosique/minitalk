# minitalk
<p>The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.<p/n>
<b>PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS</b>
<p>• Name your executable files client and server.</p>
<p>• You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not
relink.</p>
<p>• You can definitely use your libft.</p>
<p>• You have to handle errors thoroughly. In no way your program should quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, and so forth).
<p>• Your program mustn’t have memory leaks.</p>
<p>• You can have one global variable per program (one for the client and one for
the server), but you will have to justify their use.</p>
<p>• In order to complete the mandatory part, you are allowed to use the following
functions:</p>
<p>◦ write</p>
<p>◦ ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded</p>
<p>◦ signal</p>
<p>◦ sigemptyset</p>
<p>◦ sigaddset</p>
<p>◦ sigaction</p>
<p>◦ kill</p>
<p>◦ getpid</p>
<p>◦ malloc</p>
<p>◦ free</p>
<p>◦ pause</p>
<p>◦ sleep</p>
<p>◦ usleep</p>
